# Test Dependencies

This directory contains dependencies needed for unit testing.

## Catch2

We use Catch2 v3.x as our testing framework. It's downloaded as a single header file for easy integration.

To update Catch2:
```bash
cd tests/external
wget https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.4.0/catch_amalgamated.hpp
wget https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/releases/download/v3.4.0/catch_amalgamated.cpp
```
