# Profile Performance Command

Profile the $ARGUMENTS system for performance bottlenecks:

1. Identify the hot paths in the specified system
2. Measure current performance metrics:
   - Frame time
   - Pixels per second processed
   - Memory usage
   - Cache misses (if available)
3. Analyze algorithmic complexity
4. Identify top 3 optimization opportunities
5. Suggest concrete improvements with code examples

Focus areas for falling sand engine:
