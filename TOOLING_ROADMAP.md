### File Formats
- Human-readable for version control
- Efficient binary formats for distribution
- Backward compatibility
- Validation schemas

### Platform Support
- Cross-platform GUI (Qt, ImGui, or similar)
- Native feel on each platform
- Consistent keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-monitor support

## Development Priorities

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Basic Material Editor
2. Simple Level Editor with save/load
3. Performance overlay

### Should Have
1. Advanced Material Editor features
2. Simulation debugger
3. Basic profiling tools

### Nice to Have
1. Node-based reaction designer
2. Community integration
3. Advanced world generation

## Technical Stack

### Recommended Technologies
- **GUI Framework**: Dear ImGui (immediate mode, game-dev friendly)
- **Serialization**: JSON for human-readable, MessagePack for binary
- **Scripting**: Lua for tool extensions
- **Graphics**: Same as engine (OpenGL/Vulkan)

### Architecture Considerations
- Tools as separate processes
- Shared memory for live preview
- Plugin architecture for extensions
- Automated testing for tools

## Success Metrics

### Usability
- Create new material in < 1 minute
- Paint a simple level in < 5 minutes
- Identify performance issues quickly

### Performance
- Tool overhead < 5% of engine performance
- Instant preview updates
- Responsive UI at all times

### Adoption
- Used by 100% of engine users
- Community tool extensions
- Tutorial completion rate > 80%

## Conclusion

The Funhouse tooling suite will dramatically improve developer productivity and lower the barrier to entry for creating falling sand physics games. By providing intuitive, powerful tools, we enable developers to focus on creativity rather than technical implementation details.
